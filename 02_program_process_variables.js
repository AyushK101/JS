// program : code in a file is program .
// process : program in a running state is called process.
// we load program in ram , and converts program into process.
// once a process is running inside ram , we get a memory allocated.
// whenever we are going to build something , we need a mechanism to store the values.
// we do it using variables . variables are buckets in the memory which stores values.
// buckets have labels.
// there are three ways to initialize , let , var , const.
