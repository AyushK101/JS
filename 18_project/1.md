# what is an api ?
- application package/programming interface 
- api is like a contract that developer make with user.
- in this contract will be given details about how to call service , what input to provide and what output to expect.
- alot of time you are gonna make a network call mostprobably over http , provide input and get the output .

----------------------------------------------------------------------
- how about if someone built a package for you.
- internally in that package they are making the network call to that contract.
- but you are going to access the package like a function call by installing that package third party application.

----------------------------------
- axios helps you to make network call.
- sdk is similar thing to package.
