//! An "event" is an action that occurs as per the user's instruction as input and gives the output in response.

//! To react to an event, you attach an "event handler" to it. This is a block of code (usually a JavaScript function ) that runs when the event fires.

//! attaching a event handler is also called "registering an event handler".

//! Event handlers are sometimes called event listeners.

//! The listener listens out for the event happening, and the handler is the code that is run in response to it happening.

//! using addEventListener();
//objects that can fire events have an addEventListener() method.
