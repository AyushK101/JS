// STREAMS :
// continuous flow of data like input from keyboard is sent ot logic unit.

// JS gives us some already prepared ways to handle streams and file input/output.
 

// module as a word: one logical set of code => using multiple modules you can make a library.
// you can ship that library , you ship it in the form of package => multiple packages/libraries make a framework.

// therefore , in node libraries are known as packages.
